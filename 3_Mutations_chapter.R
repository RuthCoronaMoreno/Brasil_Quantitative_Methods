#Write a program to simulate just one generation of the LD experiment - stochastically. Simulate C = 500
#cultures each of which has N = 1000 cells and  = 10????3, i.e., a very high mutation rate. What is the
#distribution of resistant mutants that you observe across all the cultures? Are they similar or dissimilar to
#each other? Specify your measurement of c(m), i.e., the number of cultures with m resistant mutants. Is
#this distribution well t by a Poisson distribution? If so, what is the best t shape parameter of the Poisson
#density function and how does that relate to the microscopic value of mutation you used to generate the
#output? Finally, to what extent are the fluctuations \large" or \small"?
